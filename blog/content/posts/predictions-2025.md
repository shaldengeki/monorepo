Following up on [my predictions for 2024]({{< ref "predictions-2024-followup" >}}), here's a bunch of predictions for this year. As before, all dollar values inflation-adjusted for start of 2025.

# US

## National
- US enters a recession: 10%
- [Median YoY CPI inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEDCPIM158SFRBCLE) <2%: 40%
- US GDP >$30T: 60%

## NYC

### Housing
- ❌ 2024 estimated annual population change is <=0%: 80%
- ❌ 2024 new housing starts down from 2023 (27,980): 70%
- 2025 new housing permits issued up from 2024: 50%
- [Median listing $/sqft in the NY/Newark/Jersey City MSA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEDLISPRIPERSQUFEE35620) <$500: 20%

### Congestion pricing
- Remains in place, without significant rollbacks, by the end of the year: 70%
- ✅ I notice reduced traffic volumes in my neighborhood: 10%

### Second Avenue Subway
- ✅ Phase 2 construction [starts](https://web.archive.org/web/20250821154822/https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/Presentation_2025-08-15_SAS2_NOTES_SCRUBBED.pdf#page=18) before end of year: 90%

## California

- 2025 new housing permits issued up from 2024: 50%
- [Median listing $/sqft in the SF/Oakland/Hayward MSA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEDLISPRIPERSQUFEE41860) <$640: 20%

### HSR

I'll assess these only if the CAHSR [releases a new project update report](https://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-Project-Update-Report-SUP-FINAL-081925-A11Y.pdf), with new figures. (I think the next one is scheduled for early this year.) If they don't by the end of the year, I'll annul these predictions.

- (Annulled) P50 estimate of Bakersfield-Merced opening delayed to at least 2034: 60%
  - I consider the "P50 probability envelope" the official estimate, i.e. currently the official estimate is "end of 2033".
  - The Authority changed how it does its reporting - it no longer reports percentiles for timelines - so I'm annulling this prediction. I think the change is a negative sign about the timeline, though.
- ✅ Base YOE cost of Bakersfield-Merced [rises to or above $33B](https://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-Project-Update-Report-SUP-FINAL-081925-A11Y.pdf#page=54): 70%
- ✅ Project [officially cancelled](https://hsr.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-Project-Update-Report-SUP-FINAL-081925-A11Y.pdf#page=18): 20%
  - I'd consider any change to the project that abandons its current goal of serving SF-LA in <3hrs as cancelling it.
  - The plan abandons the idea of connecting directly to LA, instead ending at Palmdale, ~80 miles away.

  - This one is deaateable. Minecraft has had previous movie-like video games (Story Mode, a Telltale adaptation), and a documentary film (The Story of Mojang). Think the latter is close enough to just barely count.
